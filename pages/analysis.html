                    <p class = "text-info"><font size ="4">We expect the older seasons to perform better 
                    in defence and sharing the ball, whereas the newer seasons to be better at scoring. We made the assumption to bin older seasons
                    into 1999-2003 and newer seasons into 2003-2007. The is to due to influences of coach Mike d'antoni on the NBA around 2003 which put more                         emphasis on scoring. He popularised offensive plays like running and gunning, pick and rolls, and isolations.</font></p>

                    Overtime we see average APG of a player dropping gradually , not by much, but dropping nonetheless. This could be due to an excessive use of pick and roll plays, which are offense based but still involve passing, but not as much as other plays. Hence a small drop in assists per game of a player.</font></p>

It is clear that older season teams are better at defence than newer teams. One strong reason for this result is there was a rule change which banned hand checking in 2003, which in turn made defence harder and could explain this result.</font></p>

                    <p class = "text-info"><font size ="4">We suspected newer seasons to be better at scoring than older seasons, however this was not the case. Older seasons were better in scoring, passing the ball and defence. Therefore our hypothesis is partially valid. A reason why older seasons are better at defence is due to a rule change curtailing hand checking, which would have made defence harder for players. A reason for why older seasons could be better at passing might be due to different play strategies being employed. Finally, older season teams are better at scoring because the high performers in scoring may be spread out in teams, as opposed to being skewed to certain teams in newer seasons, however further analysis would be needed to prove this.</font></p>
